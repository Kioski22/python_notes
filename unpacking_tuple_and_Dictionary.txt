✔️ In enumerate(num_list):
When you write:

python
Copy
Edit
for index, value in enumerate(num_list):
You are unpacking the tuple (index, value) — that's called tuple unpacking.

✔️ In a dictionary:
Yes, you also unpack key-value pairs when looping over a dictionary.

For example:

python
Copy
Edit
for key, value in my_dict.items():
Here, .items() returns pairs like ("name", "Randy"), and you're unpacking the tuple (key, value).

So yes — in both enumerate() and dict.items(), unpacking is happening.
You're splitting a tuple into separate variables.

Let me know if you'd like a real-world analogy for it too!
