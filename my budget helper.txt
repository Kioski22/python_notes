📝 Mini Project: My Budget Helper
🎯 What Are You Making?
    You’ll build a simple tool in Python that helps you:

    Keep track of money you earn and spend

    Show you how much money you have left

    Practice turning things like text into numbers using type casting

🧰 What You’ll Learn
    How to ask the user to type something (like income or expenses)

    How to convert that input from text into numbers so you can do math

    How to add up all your income and expenses

    How to show your balance (what's left)

🧱 What You Need
    Python installed (any version 3.8 or newer is great)

    No extra libraries needed for the basic version

    Optional: If you want to save your data to a file later, you can use the built-in csv or datetime library (these come with Python)

📋 Step-by-Step Instructions (Simple English)
Step 1: Ask the user to type income or expenses
    You’ll ask the user something like:

    “Enter an income (example: 500, freelance work)”

    The user types a sentence with a number and description.

    You split the sentence at the comma to separate the number and words.

Step 2: Convert the number part from text to a real number
    Everything typed by the user is text (called a "string").

    You need to convert (or “cast”) the number part into a real number using float(), so you can add it later.

    Step 3: Store the information
    Every time the user enters an income or expense, you store it in a list, like a notebook or ledger.

    Each item has:

    A type: "income" or "expense"

    The amount (a number)

    A description (just the words)

Step 4: Do the math
Go through the list:

Add up all the income amounts

Add up all the expense amounts

Subtract expenses from income to get your final balance.

Step 5: Show a summary
    Show each entry, with its amount and description.

Show:

    Total Income

    Total Expenses

    What’s left (the balance)

Step 6: (Optional) Make it Fancy
    Save your data to a file using csv if you want to reuse it later.

    Add a date using the datetime module.

🔄 Python Concepts You’ll Use
Concept	What it Means
    input()	Ask the user to type something
    split()	Break text apart (e.g., at a comma)
    float()	Turn a number in text into a real number (for math)
    str()	Turn a number back into text (for printing)
    round()	Round off numbers to 2 decimal places
    list	Store lots of items in one place
    for loop	Go through each item one by one
