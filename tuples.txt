                     tuples are initialized in two ways 

my_tuple = ( 1, 2,"yes", True, 9.8 ) #this is a tuple *most preffered method of tuples
my_tuple =  1, 2,"yes", True, 9.8  # this is also a tuple


tuples data are immutable  
-Tuples are immutable. Once you create a tuple, you cannot change its elements.
If you try to assign a new value to an element in a tuple, you will get an error. 
and you cant delete anything in a tuple 


                       Access tuples through their index

my_tuple =("this","is","a","tuple")

my_tuple[4] = "sir!" # this adds the data to the index 4 of the tuple  
# but remember tuples are immutable and does not item assignments 
print(my_tuple)  

my_tuple = ("this","is","a","tuple")

for i in my_tuple: # this iterates over the the tuple and saves it into the i variable 
    print(i) # this prints i variable
